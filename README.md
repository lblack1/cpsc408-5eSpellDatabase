# 5e Spells Database
### Lloyd Black (for CPSC408)



#### PART 1

Completed using Python3 and SQLite, this is a simple embedded database using 4 tables (Spell, Class, Usage, and ClassSpell) to store basic information about D&D 5e Spells, their details, and their relationship to 5e Player Classes.
All files are contained in the SQLite directory.


#### PART 2

Completed using Java and MySQL, this expands on part 1 by adding the Effect, Background, and Character tables and making the interactions between all the tables more sophisticated.
All files are contained in the MySQL directory.

schema.sql inilializes the database and tables and such.
Interface.java contains source code for a CLI for some simple interactions with the Database.
txtfiles directory contains wordlists used by entrygen.py to generate sample data.
load.sql is a simple sql script to load in data more efficiently than simply running data.sql (generated by entrygen.py).
mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar is a jar file used by the CLI to interface with a local host MySQL server.

This part assumes the MySQL server is running on 127.0.0.1:3306, and must be given credentials in Interface.java before compiling.
